# Wingman Flight Deck As-Built Summary Report — 2026-04-08

Status: as-built summary report  
Flow: `2bdbacee`  
Fresh flow run: `f9099c25-a0b3-4cce-8b77-19a2e1efb2b7`  
Task ID: `f7793f50-d215-41a0-b931-63ce9a4b4e80`  
Reviewed against live working tree on 2026-04-08

## Target Project Definition

- App: Wingman Flight Deck
- Repo path: `/home/operator/code/wingmanbefree/wingman-fd`
- Repo boundary for this step: this repository only
- Deliverable for this step: summary report artifact for the current overnight as-built pass
- Required title: `Wingman Flight Deck As-Built Summary Report — 2026-04-08`

## Input Artifacts Reviewed

The required refreshed as-built inputs for this flow run were present:

- `docs/asbuilt/architecture.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/data model.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/middleware.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/frontend.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/design.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/important.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/issues.md`

Current `docs/asbuilt/` markdown set after this step:

- `docs/asbuilt/architecture.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/data model.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/design.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/frontend.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/important.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/issues.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/middleware.md`
- `docs/asbuilt/summary.md`

## Existing Vs Refreshed In This Run

- Already-existing as-built docs refreshed in this overnight pass: `architecture.md`, `data model.md`, `middleware.md`, `frontend.md`, `design.md`, `important.md`, and `issues.md`
- Step-8 summary artifact for this pass: `summary.md`

Note on step history:

- I did not find a separate in-repo step-history file or flow-log artifact for run `f9099c25-a0b3-4cce-8b77-19a2e1efb2b7`.
- This summary therefore uses the live repo state, the refreshed `docs/asbuilt/` files, and the task metadata supplied in this request.

## Main Findings From The Live Review

- Flight Deck is currently a local-first browser SPA that renders from Dexie-backed local state rather than raw Tower responses.
- The runtime is still centered on one large Alpine store in `src/app.js` and one large `index.html` template, even though shell state, live queries, sync, flows, people, and other concerns now have clearer module boundaries.
- Sync is worker-required in this snapshot. `src/sync-worker-client.js` degrades by rejecting sync work when a real worker cannot be created rather than running a main-thread fallback path.
- The background outbox flush timer is live and currently runs every 2000 ms in `src/worker/sync-worker-runner.js`.
- SSE is active but advisory only. Stream events tell the worker which families to refresh; authoritative row data still comes through the normal records pull and translator path.
- Workspace identity is backend-aware, not owner-only. The same workspace owner can map to different local workspace DBs depending on service identity or backend URL.
- Flows is a visible product section with live data, but shared route and title helpers still do not fully treat it as a first-class page.
- Jobs remains a hidden placeholder surface in source rather than a live product area in the shipped UI.

## Follow-Up Issues Captured In `docs/asbuilt/issues.md`

The current issues note identifies these obvious follow-up items:

1. Access pruning coverage lags the live materialized schema, especially for `flows`, `approvals`, `persons`, and `organisations`.
2. Flows is visible in the UI but still missing first-class route and tab-title support.
3. Workspace session-key bootstrap exists in code, but the live runtime wiring is not obvious from static review.
4. Worker fallback and flush-cadence comments are stale relative to the implementation.
5. Jobs remains a sizable dormant stub surface in source.
6. The shipped UI is still concentrated in one very large Alpine store and one very large template.
7. Legacy `Coworker` identifiers still span package, auth, storage, and deploy surfaces.

## Approval Handoff

This file is the step-8 summary artifact for the 2026-04-08 overnight as-built pass:

- Flight Deck document artifact: `docs/asbuilt/summary.md`
- Document title: `Wingman Flight Deck As-Built Summary Report — 2026-04-08`
- Attachment readiness: ready to attach to the step-9 approval package for this same flow run
