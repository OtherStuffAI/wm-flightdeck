# Flight Deck PG Classic Migration Status

## Current Status

Planning restored and app-card baseline available. `wm-fd-2` is a clean copy of `wingman-fd` with migration docs, installed dependencies, built static assets, and a running Autopilot app-card instance. Phase 1 is complete: backend mode selection, PG workspace descriptor connection, encrypted-record sync disablement, and Wingmen PG workspace bootstrap are in place.

Phase 2 is complete. PG mode can hydrate Tower PG scopes, accessible channels, chat messages/thread structure, tasks, docs, file metadata, and audio-note metadata into the existing Dexie-backed Flight Deck navigation, board, docs, files, and audio models.

Phase 3 has started with an online-only task/chat write adapter slice. This is not yet the full PH3 queue contract: offline PG writes, task scope/channel moves, attachments, and doc/file/audio writes still need the remaining tickets.

Scope/group/channel alignment is now treated as a Phase 3 blocker rather than later polish. The current app uses PG tables and API adapters, but the product admin model is incomplete until PG mode has workspace members, groups, nested groups, channel grants, and channel/thread-scoped record context.

## Decisions

- Preserve the existing Flight Deck UI.
- Preserve Dexie as local/offline materialized state.
- Replace encrypted record sync with PG backend adapters in PG mode.
- Use Tower PG as source of truth.
- Synced PG tasks/docs are viewable offline but not editable offline.
- New local PG tasks/docs can be created and edited offline until Tower accepts them.
- Synced PG task/doc edits use PG-native Tower edit leases, not encrypted-record checkout.
- Kind `33356` is the additive PG workspace self-index path for cross-device workspace discovery; it must not change the existing kind `33357` onboarding contract.
- Keep Tower encrypted-record sync backwards compatible.
- Use the experimental `flightdeck-pg` app as API reference/test harness only, not as the product UI target.
- Dogfood with a seeded Wingmen Community PG workspace as soon as read hydration is usable.
- Do not commit generated `ecosystem.config.cjs`; Autopilot app registry owns app-card runtime process config.
- Default `wm-fd-2` to encrypted-record mode until `VITE_FLIGHT_DECK_BACKEND_MODE=tower-pg` or its compact alias is explicitly configured.

## Actions

- Created `docs/pg-migration/implementation.md`.
- Created `docs/pg-migration/architecture.md`.
- Created `docs/pg-migration/wingmen-community-bootstrap.md`.
- Created work packages under `docs/pg-migration/work-packages/`.
- A generic app-card baseline was used during the migration exercise.
- Removed the copied PM2 runtime file from source control and ignored it.
- Added PH1-01 backend-mode resolution for `encrypted-records` and `tower-pg`.
- Added PH1-02 PG auth/workspace connection wiring in `tower-pg` mode: the classic connect modal now accepts Tower PG workspace descriptors, stores verified descriptor metadata in the existing known-workspaces settings state, and calls Tower PG service, workspace list, descriptor, and `/me` routes with browser NIP-98 auth.
- Added PH1-02 focused coverage for PG descriptor parsing, credential rejection, PG workspace materialization, PG workspace identity merging, and descriptor persistence through the existing connection manager.
- Fixed PG workspace normalization so descriptor-backed workspaces do not generate or persist SuperBased connection tokens.
- Hardened PH1-02 cached PG workspace activation: verified descriptors are now scoped to the authenticated session npub plus Tower/workspace/app identity, cached PG workspaces are filtered to the active signer, and cached selections re-run descriptor plus `/me` verification before becoming active after reload or login.
- Recovered PH1-02 from a stalled pipeline run, retained the useful partial patch, and completed tests/build locally.
- Recovered PH1-03 from a stalled pipeline run and completed the sync gating locally.
- Added PH1-03 PG-mode sync guard: when `tower-pg` backend mode is active, the classic encrypted-record worker sync, worker flush timer, background tick, access prune, status refresh, and SSE stream startup are intentionally disabled while the existing encrypted-records mode remains unchanged.
- Hardened PH1-03 repair paths so Tower PG mode also no-ops encrypted-record family restore, quarantine retry, pending-write Tower repair, task-family backfill, and direct family pulls before they clear Dexie sync state or enqueue encrypted worker pulls.
- Added visible disabled sync status text/badge styling for Tower PG mode so the classic avatar menu does not imply encrypted-record sync is running.
- Renamed completed PH1-01 through PH1-03 work packages with the `COMPLETED-` prefix to prevent accidental redispatch.
- Completed PH1-04 Tower/CLI bootstrap: Tower setup seeds generic workspace defaults, group permissions include task/chat/doc/file/audio surfaces, and `flightdeck-cli` has a one-command `smoke task` create/read/list verification.
- Verified the seeded local PG workspace, scope, channels, and descriptor-import flow with synthetic identities.
- Fixed Tower migration runner bootstrap ordering so `CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS` statements run before tables with sequence-backed defaults.
- Renamed completed PH1-04 work package with the `COMPLETED-` prefix.
- Completed PH2-01 PG read hydrator: added Tower PG scope/channel/thread API helpers, DB-master Dexie replace helpers, local PG-to-classic row mappers, and workspace/bootstrap hooks so connected PG workspaces populate the existing scope/channel/thread UI.
- Renamed completed PH2-01 work package with the `COMPLETED-` prefix.
- Completed PH2-02 PG read hydrator: added Tower PG channel message, channel task, and scope task API helpers; mapped PG messages and tasks into classic Flight Deck rows; hydrated tasks after PG workspace bootstrap/switch; and retained PG channel/thread IDs on local task rows for later channel/thread board zoom.
- Renamed completed PH2-02 work package with the `COMPLETED-` prefix.
- Completed PH2-03 PG read hydrator: added Tower PG docs/files/audio metadata API helpers; mapped PG docs into classic documents, PG files into storage-link document rows for the existing Files browser, and PG audio notes into classic audio-note rows; hydrated docs/files/audio after PG workspace bootstrap/switch.
- Renamed completed PH2-03 work package with the `COMPLETED-` prefix.
- Added initial Phase 3 online write adapter slice: Tower PG POST/PATCH helpers, a PG write adapter module, PG-mode task create/update/state routing, and PG-mode chat thread/message/reply creation from the existing classic UI. Kept PH3 tickets open because the offline queue and broader write surfaces are not complete.
- Added PH4-04 design/work package for PG-native edit leases and offline edit gating: synced task/doc rows are read-only offline; local unsynced creates remain editable until first sync.
- Added PH5-03 work package for kind `33356` PG workspace self-index discovery. This is additive to PG workspace login and explicitly preserves the existing kind `33357` onboarding contract while another implementation thread owns that flow.
