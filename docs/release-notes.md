# Flight Deck release notes

Flight Deck stores user-visible release notes in root-level `release-notes.json`. The Vite build validates that manifest and embeds its ordered history in `dist/version.json`; release notes are static build metadata, not Tower workspace records.

## Add the next release

1. Read `absoluteVersion` from `.build-meta.json` and use the next integer as `buildNumber`.
2. Append one entry to `release-notes.json` in ascending `buildNumber` order. Give it a short `label` and concise plain-text `notes` (each note is limited to 280 characters).
3. Run `bun run test`, then run `bun run build` once for the release output. The build must reach the authored build number; it rejects notes assigned to a future build.
4. Run `bun run verify:dist`, then commit the manifest, `.build-meta.json`, and
   source changes. `dist/` is generated deployment output and is not committed.

The absolute build number is the comparison key. The human-readable timestamp build ID is retained for display and must not be sorted lexically.

An internal build with no user-visible change does not need a manifest entry. If recording that build explicitly is useful, add an entry with a meaningful `label`, an empty `notes` array, and `"noUserVisibleChanges": true`; the upgrade panel will say that the build has no user-visible changes. Never add placeholder or invented notes.

Entries are immutable history after release. Do not reuse or reorder build numbers. The build and tests reject malformed entries, duplicate/out-of-order build numbers, empty visible releases, and ambiguous no-change entries.
